# Bartlebee-Bookster
Bartlebee Bookster represents a significant investment of time and money from my Dad, Mom, and siblings in 1993. My Dad always wanted to help everyone learn how to read. He hoped these Bartlebee Bookster Lessons would be made widely available. 

Each of the five Bartlebee lessons has a video and booklet that go together.

He also wrote a book, _Reading Begins at Home_, that has content to help parents teach their children how to read.
